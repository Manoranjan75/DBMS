## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Introduction
An overview of **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**, the role of databases in modern applications, and why database management is crucial for maintaining data integrity and performance.

### 2. DBM Architecture
Learn about the different types of DBMS architectures, including **Single-Tier**, **Two-Tier**, and **Three-Tier architectures**, and how they affect database management and scalability.

### 3. ER Model & ER Diagram
Understand the **Entity-Relationship (ER) Model**—a crucial concept for database design that uses entities, attributes, and relationships. Detailed ER diagrams illustrate how to map real-world entities to database tables.

### 4. Relational Model
Covers the transition from the **ER Model** to the **Relational Model**, focusing on how relational databases store data in tables, and how relations, tuples, and attributes interact.

### 5. Normalization
A detailed breakdown of normalization techniques, including **1NF**, **2NF**, **3NF**, and **BCNF**, along with examples of how to eliminate data redundancy and ensure data integrity.

### 6. ACID vs BASE
- **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability—essential properties for reliable transaction processing.
- **BASE Properties**: Discusses the trade-offs between **BASE** (Basically Available, Soft State, Eventual Consistency) in NoSQL systems vs ACID in SQL databases.

### 7. Indexing
Explains different types of **Indexing** and how they improve query performance, along with real-world examples and scenarios where indexing is beneficial.

### 8. Clustering and Partitioning
An introduction to advanced database design techniques such as **Database Clustering** and **Partitioning**, and how they help in scaling databases for high-availability systems.

### 9. CAP Theorem
A crucial concept for distributed databases, explaining the trade-off between **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance** in database systems.

### 10. Master-Slave Database
Explores **Master-Slave replication** architecture, its use cases, and its importance for maintaining data consistency in distributed databases.

## 💼 Why This Repository?

I created these notes during my study of **Database Management Systems** to solidify my understanding of the core and advanced database concepts. These notes serve as a guide for both beginners and intermediate learners who want to dive deeper into DBMS and database technologies like MySQL and NoSQL. 

By making them public, I hope to help others learn and master databases, as well as demonstrate my dedication to understanding and documenting key database principles.
